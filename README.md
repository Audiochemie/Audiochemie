👋 Hi, I’m @Audiochemie.   
@Audiochemie is my old DJ name, back in the Days when I still had time to put some vinyl onto turntables 🎧. 
In real life I'm known (and hopefully not feared) as Timo Schulz 🙂   
My main interested is in quantum chemistry (QC).  Though, I'm also interested a lot in _real_ chemistry, physics, all things quantum and mathematics. 
For my everyday work I'm mostly using scripting languages (`Python` 🐍, Shell scripts) and good old `(g)awk`
to get me all the information I need from output files of the plethora of QC program packages I'm using for my research.  
Though, I also do a big deal of _real_ programming (mostly `Fortran`) to calculate molecular properties from a more semi-empirical, though still _ab-initio_, approach.  
You can check out the method I helped improve [here](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07951) and hopefully soon a work on spin-spin coupling based on these wavefunctions.  
The things I put on here are mainly dedicated to my learning progress of `Rust`.   

If you want to get in touch just write me a mail. 📧
